# API-Weather-Gui
#This API Weather Gui takes from an API from the website https://openweathermap.org/api. The Gui asks the user to enter any city in the world in a input box and click the "Get Weather" button. Once the button is clicked, a popup will come up with a picture depicting the weather condition, the current temperature in the city in fahrenheit and celsius, and a written statement of the weather condition. If the weather condition is clear a picture of a sun or moon will come up dependin on the time of the city. Once the user clicks the "OK" button on the popup, the popup will close and the input box will clear allowing the user to type in a new input. On the main window there is also a "Reset" button and an "Exit" button which both does exactly what it says (deleting whatever is in the input box and exiting the gui).
